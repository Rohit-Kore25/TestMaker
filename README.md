# TestMaker
#A simple Testmaker(MCQ based tests). There are two roles: 'teacher' and 'student'

#Lets see who you are? teacher or student?

#Lets dive in teacher's section(as it has the most of the features ofc 😅)
it has 4 Options, you can create a new test, manage the existing tests, manage your class students and view the scores of the students who have given the tests

#lets create a test:
So here we are creating our fresh and new test!
you can add the test title, add question description, four options and the correct answer as well(ofc the computer is not so smart enough to predict the right answer lol)

#lets try adding a question:
the following view shows how a preview is generated after adding question(s):
after adding a question, you get options to update and delete the question as well(sadly if you have mistaken 😁)

as you can see above, a teacher gets to know if he has correctly typed the right answer and all the questions look good before submitting the quiz into DB(OFC mistakes can happen and there's an update option in 'manage quiz' as well, please be patient)
after clicking on create new test, the test will be saved to DB

#lets head over to the manage test section:
here you can see which tests you have made so far, delete a test if not needed, view the test and set the test active/not active. A student can only give the quiz which is set active by teacher.
Currently the Hydrogen test is active and others are not. just by clicking on 'not active' you can set them to active. it's easy

After clicking on a test, you can view it as well. It also displays the status and gives you the option to update the test.

#we can also view the results of the students who have given the quiz, but for that let's first give a quiz!




#Lets go in the students section:
if you log in as student you have two choice, first -> give a test and get your score, after that you can analyse the test as well

#lets give a test: here you can see the tests which are set active by the teacher

lets analayse the given test. in the analyse section, you can view the tests attempted and after clicking on it you can see the stats:
a single highlighted answer means your answer and correct answer are the same(light green), if they differ, your answer is shown in orange and right answer in dark green color
